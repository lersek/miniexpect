miniexpect is a very simple expect-like library for C.

It has a saner interface than libexpect, and doesn't depend on Tcl.
It is also thread safe, const-correct and uses modern C standards.

It is standalone, except that it requires the PCRE (Perl Compatible
Regular Expressions) library from http://www.pcre.org/.  The PCRE
dependency is fundamental because we want to offer the most powerful
regular expression syntax to match on, but more importantly because
PCRE has a convenient way to detect partial matches which made this
library very simple to implement.
